## About the Video Course
Web development is moving fast and to keep up to mark, you need a technology stack that is . The MEAN stack includes MongoDb, Express, Angular, and Node.js. These tools provide a rich environment to build advanced web applications in a short space of time. All the pieces of the MEAN stack are practically tried and tested in large and small-scale organizations.

Mastering MEAN Web Development will guide you through all the necessary pieces to build a web app from start to finish. We will discuss the concepts and methods in depth, and shine light on how and why we use each piece of the MEAN stack.

We’ll begin by learning how to use Webpack and Babel to assemble our frontend. We’ll see how to leverage many of the new features in Angular2. We’ll create a RESTful API built with Node.js and MongoDB.

Along the way, we’ll touch up on best practices used to create, manage, and deploy web applications to production. Your skills and understanding of JavaScript will increase as you add web sockets, models, and other essential elements to your web application.

Mastering MEAN Web Development will cover all the topics you need to create your own web apps for organizations, small or big.
